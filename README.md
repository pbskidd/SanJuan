 SanJuan (Pirate Map Evite)

A rather silly Evite I whipped up. It was a lot of fun making a pirate map of my city in Photoshop ... but it still needed something. 

I decided to make it a webpage so that I could fully immerse my guests in that sea-sick feeling, even before they got to the boat.

The evite links to a pirate-themed Google maps skin that I found online. At one point, it also auto-filled location information and had a splashy rain effect ... but I wanted to keep it tasteful.
