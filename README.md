 SanJuan (Pirate Map Evite)

A rather silly Evite I whipped up. It was a lot of fun making a pirate map of my city in Photoshop ... but it still needed something. I decided to make it a webpage so that I could fully immerse my guests in that sea sick feeling even before they got to the boat.

The evite links to a pirate-themed Google maps skin that I found online. At one point, it autofilled location information and also had a splashy rain effect. I removed those before production... you know, to keep it tasteful.
